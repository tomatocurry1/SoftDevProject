How to setup the game:

1. Get the requisite LWJGL3 libraries:
	lwgjl.jar
	lwgjl-opengl.jar
	lwgjl-glfw.jar
	and their respective native OS counterparts.
	
	*Note that for mac, -XstartOnFirstThread option is required as an VM argument.

2. A library was required to take the PNG files and convert it to a bytestream. 
	http://twl.l33tlabs.org/dist/PNGDecoder.jar
	
3. The testing was done with JUnit4.

4. Lastly, code coverage was tested with the EclEmma extension in eclipse.
